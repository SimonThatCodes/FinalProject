Good Day po Sir, While uploading files here in Git i find it that some files can be uploaded due to some files being hidden or 
just way to big or exceeds the limit of 100 files in 1 folder due to the structure of each frameworks, but all the  necesarry code of my projects 
are provided, but the application may or may not run, becuase i dont know if those file that git hub can't accept may need to run the application or not
